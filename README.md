# HI there I'M Brian Mwirigi

I design, build, and integrate software systems that function reliably in imperfect and evolving environments — but I also think beyond the immediate, exploring what these systems *could become*. 

I operate at the intersection of **execution, systems thinking, and forward-looking design**, blending rigorous implementation with clever, high-leverage solutions.

## 🚀 Core Capabilities

### **Intelligent & Agentic Systems**
* **Design:** Build agent-based systems with goals, memory, and structured decision flows.
* **Orchestration:** Coordinate AI tools, services, and data pipelines.
* **Control:** Implement human-in-the-loop monitoring, evaluation, and safety protocols.
* **Integration:** Embed AI into existing products and operational workflows.

### **Backend, APIs & Real-Time Systems**
* **API Design:** REST, GraphQL, and event-driven paradigms.
* **Connectivity:** Work with legacy systems and third-party API integrations.
* **Real-Time:** Build systems using hooks, webhooks, and WebSockets.
* **Efficiency:** Employ inventive patterns to reduce complexity and increase efficiency.

### **System Integration & Architecture**
* **Interoperability:** Connect heterogeneous systems with conflicting assumptions.
* **Middleware:** Design adapters and gateways to reduce system friction.
* **Evolution:** Build modular architectures that scale without collapsing.

### **Machine Learning & AI Systems**
* **Functional AI:** Integrate ML models as system components, not standalone experiments.
* **Pipelines:** Build inference pipelines, monitoring systems, and feedback loops.
* **Validation:** Measure and manage performance by treating AI outputs critically.

### **Frontend & Operator Interfaces**
* **Clarity:** Build interfaces that clarify complex system states and behaviors.
* **Prioritization:** Focus on usability and maintainability over aesthetics.
* **Scale:** Design interfaces that allow for oversight as system complexity grows.

## 🧠 How I Work

* **Defensive Design:** Assume systems will be misused, data will be incomplete, and integrations will break.
* **Resilience:** Design specifically for recovery, observability, and future extensibility.
* **Rigor + Invention:** Combine critical engineering rigor with inventive, clever solutions.
* **Transparency:** Document assumptions and trade-offs clearly.

## 🎯 What I Care About

* **Reliability:** Systems that remain useful and understandable under real-world conditions.
* **Accountability:** Intelligent behavior that remains under human visibility and control.
* **High Leverage:** Finding the "clever" solutions that solve today's problems while anticipating the future.
* **Scalability:** Interfaces between components, teams, and responsibilities that can grow.
