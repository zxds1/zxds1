## Hi there 👋

# I'M Brian Mwirigi

I design, build, and integrate software systems that are expected to function reliably in imperfect and evolving environments — but I also think beyond the immediate, exploring what these systems *could become*.  

I operate at the intersection of **execution, systems thinking, and forward-looking design**, blending rigorous implementation with clever, high-leverage solutions.

## Core Capabilities

### Intelligent & Agentic Systems
- Build agent-based systems with goals, memory, and structured decision flows
- Orchestrate AI tools, services, and data pipelines
- Implement human-in-the-loop controls, monitoring, and evaluation
- Integrate AI into existing products and operational workflows
- Explore clever architectures and behaviors that anticipate future needs
- Balance autonomy with safety, observability, and accountability

---

### Backend, APIs & Real-Time Systems
- Design APIs using REST, GraphQL, and event-driven paradigms
- Work with existing systems and third-party APIs
- Build real-time systems using hooks, webhooks, and WebSockets
- Implement authentication, authorization, and role-based access
- Optimize for maintainability, predictability, and integration readiness
- Employ inventive patterns to reduce complexity and increase efficiency

---

### System Integration & Architecture
- Connect heterogeneous systems with conflicting assumptions
- Design adapters, gateways, and middleware to reduce friction
- Explicitly model workflows, data flows, and failure modes
- Build modular architectures that evolve without collapsing
- Anticipate future requirements and design for extensibility

---

### Machine Learning & AI Systems
- Integrate ML models as functional system components, not standalone experiments
- Build inference pipelines, monitoring systems, and feedback loops
- Treat AI outputs critically: measure, validate, and manage performance
- Introduce clever optimizations to improve efficiency, accuracy, or adaptability
- Explore future-facing ML applications while keeping systems grounded

---

### Frontend & Operator Interfaces
- Build operator/admin interfaces that clarify system state and behavior
- Prioritize usability, predictability, and maintainability over aesthetics
- Design interfaces that scale with complexity and allow oversight
- Consider how present design decisions affect future expansion

---

## Tools & Technologies

**Languages:** Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, Dart, SQL,C,Java
**Frameworks & Platforms:** Backend frameworks, React, REST, GraphQL, WebSockets, event-driven and webhook-based integrations  
**Practices:** Modular design, config-driven systems, environment separation, explicit assumptions, disciplined Git workflows

---

## How I Work

- Assume systems will be misused, data will be incomplete, and integrations will break  
- Design for recovery, observability, and future extensibility  
- Combine **critical rigor** with **inventive, clever solutions**  
- Document assumptions and trade-offs clearly  
- Balance practical reliability with visionary thinking

---

## What I Care About

- Systems that remain useful and understandable under real conditions  
- Intelligent behavior with visibility, control, and accountability  
- Reducing operational and integration risk without limiting innovation  
- Interfaces between components, teams, and responsibilities that scale  
- Finding **high-leverage, clever solutions** that anticipate the future  
- Building foundations that remain valuable as requirements, teams, and markets evolve
